## üöÄ Next Steps: Implementation Roadmap

### **Step 1: Run Database Migration** üîß

```bash
# Open Supabase SQL Editor at:
# https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT/sql

# Run the migration file:
scripts/020_maharlika_rewards_system.sql
```

**What this creates:**
- `loyalty_tiers` (Bronze, Silver, Gold configuration)
- `loyalty_members` (customer enrollments)
- `loyalty_transactions` (points history)
- `rewards_catalog` (available rewards)
- `reward_redemptions` (redemption tracking)
- `loyalty_promotions` (campaign management)
- `loyalty_referrals` (referral tracking)

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Check tables were created
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name LIKE 'loyalty%' OR table_name LIKE 'reward%';

-- View default tiers
SELECT * FROM loyalty_tiers ORDER BY tier_level;

-- View default rewards
SELECT reward_name, points_required, dollar_value FROM rewards_catalog;
```

### **Step 2: Build Rewards API Endpoints** üîå

```

#### `/app/api/rewards/balance/route.ts`

```typescript

```

```typescript

```

#### `/app/api/rewards/history/route.ts`
```typescript
// Get transaction history
// Filter by type (earn/redeem/bonus)

```

  return `You have ${member.current_points_balance} points! 
          That's enough for ${availableRewards}.`
}

// Suggest rewards-eligible items
if (mode === "search") {
  // Highlight items that earn bonus points
  // Show "2x points today!" badges
}

if (memberJustAdvancedTier) {
  return `üéâ Congratulations! You've reached ${newTier} status!
          You've unlocked: ${newBenefits}`

  return `üéÇ Happy Birthday! We've added ${birthdayBonus} bonus points 
          to your account!`
}
```
