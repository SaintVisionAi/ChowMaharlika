## 🚧 What You Need to Build

### Phase 1: Product Images (PRIORITY)

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Database has `image_url` column
- ✅ Image fallback system exists
- ❌ No image upload UI for admin
- ❌ No Supabase Storage configured

**What You Need:**

1. **Set up Supabase Storage**
   ```bash
   # Create storage bucket in Supabase dashboard
   # Bucket name: product-images
   # Make it public for easy access
   ```

2. **Create Admin Image Upload UI**
   - Component to upload images for each product
   - Drag & drop interface
   - Image preview before upload
   - Bulk upload capability

3. **Update Products with Images**
   - Link Clover products to uploaded images
   - Ability to override with custom image
   - Image optimization (resize, compress)

**Files to Create:**
- `components/admin/product-image-upload.tsx` - Upload UI
- `app/api/products/upload-image/route.ts` - Upload handler
- `app/admin/products/page.tsx` - Admin product management page

---

### Phase 2: Delivery Platform Integrations

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Framework exists (`lib/delivery-platforms.ts`)
- ✅ Placeholder functions created
- ❌ No real API integrations
- ❌ No webhook handlers for delivery platforms

**Delivery Platforms to Integrate:**

#### Tier 1 (Must Have):
1. **Uber Eats**
   - API integration for menu sync
   - Webhook for incoming orders
   - Order status updates
   
2. **DoorDash**
   - Same as Uber Eats
   
3. **Grubhub**
   - Same as Uber Eats

#### Tier 2 (Nice to Have):
4. **OpenTable** - For reservations
5. **ChowNow** - Direct ordering
6. **Toast** - Additional POS integration

**What You Need for Each Platform:**

```typescript
// Example structure
export async function uberEatsIntegration() {
  // 1. OAuth authentication
  // 2. Menu sync API
  // 3. Webhook endpoint for orders
  // 4. Order status update API
  // 5. Error handling & retry logic
}
```

**Files to Create:**
- `app/api/delivery/ubereats/webhook/route.ts`
- `app/api/delivery/doordash/webhook/route.ts`
- `app/api/delivery/grubhub/webhook/route.ts`
- `lib/integrations/uber-eats.ts` - API client
- `lib/integrations/doordash.ts` - API client
- `lib/integrations/grubhub.ts` - API client

**Environment Variables Needed:**
```bash
# Uber Eats
UBER_EATS_CLIENT_ID=
UBER_EATS_CLIENT_SECRET=
UBER_EATS_STORE_ID=

# DoorDash
DOORDASH_DEVELOPER_ID=
DOORDASH_KEY_ID=
DOORDASH_SIGNING_SECRET=

# Grubhub

```
